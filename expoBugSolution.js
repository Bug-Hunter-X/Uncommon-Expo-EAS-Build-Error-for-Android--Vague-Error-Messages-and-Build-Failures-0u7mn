Troubleshooting this uncommon Expo EAS Android build error requires a systematic approach:

1. **Verify Android Development Environment:** Ensure the Android SDK, NDK, and build tools are correctly installed and configured.  Check your Android Studio setup and environment variables.

2. **Examine Log Files:** Meticulously examine the complete EAS build logs.  Look for any warnings or error messages that might provide clues about the underlying problem, no matter how insignificant they seem.

3. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all project dependencies, including native modules, are correctly defined and installed.  Run `expo prebuild` to check for any issues during the prebuild phase.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning the build cache and rebuilding the project from scratch.  This can resolve temporary issues.

5. **Simplify the Project:** If possible, try to create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problem.  Remove any unnecessary code or plugins that could be contributing to the issue.

6. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Make sure your Expo CLI and the Expo SDK versions are up-to-date.  Outdated versions can introduce compatibility problems.

7. **Contact Expo Support:** If none of the above steps resolves the error, contact Expo support for assistance. Provide them with the detailed build logs to aid in diagnosis.

**Example (expoBugSolution.js - Illustrative):**
```javascript
// This file doesn't directly solve the error, but shows how to check for things
const androidSDKPath = process.env.ANDROID_HOME; // Check if this is set correctly
if (!androidSDKPath) {
  console.error('ANDROID_HOME environment variable not set!');
}
// ...other checks and error handling...
```
