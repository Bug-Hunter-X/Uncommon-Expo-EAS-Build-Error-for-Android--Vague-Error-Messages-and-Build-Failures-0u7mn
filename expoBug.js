This error typically occurs when you're using the Expo CLI and encounter issues related to the `eas-build` process, particularly if you're trying to build an Android app.  The underlying cause could be several things, including incorrect project setup, problems with your Android development environment, or issues with the EAS build service itself.  It can manifest in various ways, often with vague error messages that don't pinpoint the root cause.  For instance, you might see general build failures, warnings about missing dependencies, or problems with signing the APK.
